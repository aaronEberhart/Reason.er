# Reason.er

This is my ongoing project to develop an ALC tableau reasoner. 

Currently the random syntax generator is functional and accesible through the main test class. The default toString() method displays detailed information, but OWL function syntax and Description Logic style output can be obtained from the toFSString() and toDLString() on a generated Knowledge Base. This is useful primarily when written to a text file. A method is included that does this for you.

The <a href="https://aaroneberhart.github.io/Reason.er/Javadoc/" target="_blank">Javadoc</a> might be helpful if anything is unclear.

Tips:<ol>
<li>universe/individuals should be > 2 or it may behave erratically (why would you want a KB of just one class anyways?)</li>
<li>quantificationDepth/maxSubExpressions will permit a dramatic increase in the size of your expressions as they increase</li>
<li>maxSize is still a little buggy but seems to have a flatter efect on the types expressions than the other two</li>
<li>NUMTESTS is just for repeating the whole generator process if you want to test</li>
<li>ABOXSIZE/TBOXSIZE determine the number of expressions created in each respectively</li>
</ol>

There is a folder that contains sample files generated by the syntax generator. This output is typical and has not been altered. 

Settings Used to Produce Sample Output:<ul>
<li>NUMTESTS = 1</li>
<li>ABOXSIZE = 15</li>
<li>TBOXSIZE = 15</li>
<li>quantificationDepth = 10</li>
<li>maxSubExpressions = 10</li>
<li>maxSize = 50</li>
<li>universe = Predicate.uppers.length - 1</li>
<li>individuals = Term.lowers.length / 2</li>
</ul>
